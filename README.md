# WarpPlugin

Add a `/warp` command to your Minecraft server, allowing players to save and teleport to multiple locations with custom names! Built for PaperMC servers.  
**[PaperMC Documentation](https://papermc.io/)**

## 🚀 Features

### Effortless Teleportation
- Save locations with memorable names (e.g., "Castle" or "Market")
- Instantly teleport using `/warp to <name>` - no coordinates needed!

### Precision & Consistency
- **Block-Centered Saving**: Warps are saved at the **center of blocks** for perfect alignment
- **Snapped Directions**: Automatically face the nearest cardinal/diagonal angle (0°, 45°, 90°, etc.)

### Player-Centric Design
- Private warp lists per player
- Persistent storage across server restarts
- Simple management with commands:
  - `/warp rename <old> <new>`
  - `/warp remove <name>`
  - `/warp list`
